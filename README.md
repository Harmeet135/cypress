## About
Cypress is a collaboration platform, enabling real-time, simultaneous document editing and project management for teams. It combines live cursor tracking, secure authentication, and efficient subscription handling through Stripe to provide a seamless user experience
Try it at :-

  (Real  Time collab might not work due vercel's serverless functions have a maximum execution duration so it cant maintain a websocket connection)
